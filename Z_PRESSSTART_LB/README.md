## Understanding the Game

Press Start is a cryptic puzzle. The user is given 10 clues and 10 questions to answer. 

#### The 10 Clues

The player is presented with ten clues to help them solve the puzzle; however, upon reading them, it is clear that the clues contradict each other. 

The key to working out which clues are fake is to look for two clues that reinforce each other. Number 5 and number 7 reinforce one another. Together, they are two alternating statements that are true (as clue 5 claims) and, as clue 7 claims, clue number 5 is true.

> 1. Every item has a pair
> 2. You cannot win this game
> 3. Leave but one thing blank
> 4. Leave nothing blank
> 5. **Every other statement is a lie**
> 6. The statement above is a lie
> 7. **Statement number 5 is true**
> 8. I’m loving it
> 9. Whereof one cannot speak...
> 10. What does the fox say?

Once the player has worked this out, they can cross out each even clue, leaving them with the following list of helpful clues:

> 1. Every item has a pair
> 2. ~~You cannot win this game~~
> 3. Leave but one thing blank
> 4. ~~Leave nothing blank~~
> 5. Every other statement is a lie
> 6. ~~The statement above is a lie~~
>7. Statement number 5 is true
> 8. ~~I’m loving it~~
> 9. Whereof one cannot speak...
> 10. ~~What does the fox say?~~
