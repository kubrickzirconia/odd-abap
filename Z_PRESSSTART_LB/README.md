## Selection Screens in SAP

Press Start works using selection screens. Usually to retreive data from the database.

For Press Start, pressing execute reveals whether the player has solved the puzzle. If they have, a winner message is displayed. If they have not, a loser message is displayed.

## Solution: Understanding the Game

Press Start is a cryptic puzzle. The user is given 10 clues and 10 questions to answer. Please see below for an explanation of the puzzle's cryptic clues. The following also includes the puzzle's solution. 

#### The 10 Clues

The player is presented with ten clues to help them solve the puzzle; however, upon reading them, it is clear that the clues contradict each other. 

The key to working out which clues are fake is to look for two clues that reinforce each other. Number 5 and number 7 reinforce one another. Together, they are two alternating statements that are true (as clue 5 claims) and, as clue 7 claims, clue number 5 is true.

> 1. Every item has a pair
> 2. You cannot win this game
> 3. Leave but one thing blank
> 4. Leave nothing blank
> 5. **Every other statement is a lie**
> 6. The statement above is a lie
> 7. **Statement number 5 is true**
> 8. I’m loving it
> 9. Whereof one cannot speak...
> 10. What does the fox say?

Once the player has worked this out, they can cross out each even clue, leaving them with the following list of helpful clues:

> 1. Every item has a pair
> 2. ~~You cannot win this game~~
> 3. Leave but one thing blank
> 4. ~~Leave nothing blank~~
> 5. Every other statement is a lie
> 6. ~~The statement above is a lie~~
>7. Statement number 5 is true
> 8. ~~I’m loving it~~
> 9. Whereof one cannot speak...
> 10. ~~What does the fox say?~~

#### Answering the Questions

As clue number 1 states, every item in the puzzle has a pair. So, the player needs to answer the questions in such a way that there are 5 pairs of answers. 

The game is difficult precisely because they are so many red herrings - so many different ways to interpret the questions put forward. Although there are many different interpretations, there is only one set of correct answers. The following explains the solution to the game: 

**I can has cheezburger?**

DOG/BIRD/CAT/SNAKE pairs with Cheezeburger?

Check the cheezeburger checkbox so that the cat can has cheezburger. 

**How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?**

WOODSTOCK/CHARLIE/LINUS pairs with ANGELICA/TOMMY/CHUCKIE

Mashing the words Woodstock and Chuckie together creates the word woodchuck.

**Lochness Monster**

Open me pairs with MC/NESS

The answer to Open Me is LOCK - because, although you use a key to open things, the thing that you open is a lock. Pairing Loch and Ness creates the word "lochness". 

**The Communist Manifesto**

HAMMER/CHAIN SICK/WELL

Hammer & Sick = Hammer & Sickle

**The Sound of Silence**

hold your peace pairs with WTF/ASL/LOL

Clue number 3 reveals that one of the answers should be left blank. 

ASL (age/sex/location) is internet slang commonly used by _single_ people when getting to know one another. This means that in this pair there is a single answer. Hold Your Peace should be left blank - speak now or forever hold your peace - the player stays silent, holding their peace.
