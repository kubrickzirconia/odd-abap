SAP is software designed to manage business processes across all of the major functions of an enterprise (ERP). It touches customer relations, human resources, supply chain, finance, and just about any other area of business. Companies use it as a centralised database, to streamline their processes.

The programs in this repository can be used for more whimsical ends. Playful.
