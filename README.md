SAP is a gigantic, multinational corporation offering business software packages designed to help companies manage their business processes across all of the major functions of an enterprise (ERP). It touches customer relations, human resources, supply chain, finance, and just about any other area of business. The SAP GUI is amusingly utilitarian: a washed out blue colour palette, with retro navigation buttons.

ABAP is the proprietary language of SAP, used to write both standardised business applications and the fundamental system itself. Those working with ABAP can use it to write customer exensions or to write entirely new software applications. ABAP programs use Open SQL statements to query the underlying Database Management System (DBMS).

The programs in this repository have been created to use ABAP more playfully. Using the technical capabilities of SAP software to play with extraneous functionality.

All of the programs and applications uploaded here use the following naming convention:

SAP requires all customers to start their names with customer namespace: a y or a z. I've added my initials to the end of each project to identify them within the sandbox system I use.
